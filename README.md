IBM offered a data science specialization on Coursera. This was an intensive, 5 course certification that took about 100 hours to complete.

Although, I had strong foundations, the specialization helped me scope work, structure projects, and deliver a clean final presentation.

This repo contains my work from the final course, which was the Capstone.

The purpose of the project was to analyze SpaceX launch results to make recommendations that increase success and reduce costs.
